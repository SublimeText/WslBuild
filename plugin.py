class WslExecCommand(ExecCommand):
    """
    The class defines a `wsl_exec` sublime build system target to run commands via WSL2.

    - execute Linux commands
    - provides Linux paths in variables such as `$unix_file`
    - properly set ENV variables for Linux commands

    REQUIRED KEYS
    ===

    wsl_cmd
    ---

    Set `wsl_cmd` instead of `cmd`. The command is executed by WSL.
    Build variables such as $file have a $unix_file counter part with unix style paths.

    Can be a `string` or `list` of strings.

    OPTIONAL KEYS
    ===

    wsl_working_dir
    ---

    Set `wsl_working_dir` instead of `working_dir`.
    Build variables such as $file have a $unix_file counter part with unix style paths.

    wsl_env
    ---

    Set `wsl_env` instead of `env` to set environment variables that are available to
    the Linux command.

    Environment variables can be terminated by conversion flags
    to specify how their values are treated by WSL.

        Example:
            "MY_PATH/p": "C:\\Path\\to\\File"

            is converted to:

            a) MY_PATH=/mnt/c/Path/to/File when running unix commands
            b) MY_PATH=C:\\Path\\to\\File when running windows commands

    `/p` flag
        This flag indicates that a path should be translated between WSL paths and
        Win32 paths. Notice in the example below how we set the var in WSL, add it
        to WSLENV with the `/p` flag, and then read the variable from cmd.exe and
        the path translates accordingly.

    `/l` flag
        This flag indicates the value is a list of paths. In WSL, it is a
        colon-delimited list. In Win32, it is a semicolon-delimited list.

    `/u` flag
        This flag indicates the value should only be included
        when invoking WSL from Win32.

    `/w` flag
        Notice how it does not convert the path automaticallyâ€”we need to specify
        the /p flag to do this.

    Example Build System to run file in WSL:
    ===

    ```jsonc
    {
        "target": "wsl_exec",
        "cancel": {"kill": true},
        "wsl_cmd": ["./$unix_file"],
        "wsl_working_dir": "$unix_file_path",
    }
    ```

    Example Build Systems for a Rails app in WSL:
